\section*{Introduction}
\subsection*{Assumptions}
All groups are assumed to be Hausdorff topological groups unless otherwise stated. If a non-Hausdorff topology is created for a group, we pass silently to the universal Hausdorff quotient.

\section{Background}
\subsection{} locally compact groups are a classic field of study
\subsection{} lower-totally-bounded groups, the non-local version, are equivalent to groups whose lower completions are compact, and have been studied in recent years
\section{Definitions}
\subsection{} locally lower-totally-bounded $:\exists U$, a neighborhood of $e$, such that $U$ is lower-totally-bounded
\subsubsection{} in that case $aUb$ is also lower-totally-bounded
\subsection{} uniform-locally lower-totally-bounded $:\exists U$, a neighborhood of $e$, such that $\forall x:UxU\inv $ is lower-totally-bounded
\subsection{} in all the examples I have, (uniform-locally lower-totally-bounded iff locally lower-totally-bounded )
\section{Automorphisms}
\subsection{} the action by conjugation of a group $G$ on a normal subgroup $K\subset G$ is continuous
\subsection{} convergence in $G$ gives lower uniform convergence on lower-totally-bounded subsets of $K$
\subsubsection{proof} Given a neighborhood $U:e\in U\subset K, g\in G$, and $S\subset K$ lower-totally-bounded, we need a neighborhood $N:g\in N\subset G$ such that $\forall g_1\in N,x\in S\implies g_1 x g_1\inv \in Ugxg\inv U\inv $.

We start by finding (by continuity) a neighborhood $U_1:e\in U_1, U_1 U_1 U_1\inv \subset U$ and neighborhoods $N_1,V:g\in N_1\subset G,e\in V\subset K,\forall g_1\in N_1\implies g_1 V g_1\inv \subset U_1$. Since $S$ is lower-totally-bounded, there is a finite set of $x_i\in S:\forall x\in S\implies \exists i:x\in Vx_iV\inv $. Now for each $x_i$ we can find (by continuity again) neighborhoods $N_{2,i}:g\in N_{2,i}\subset G,\forall g_1\in N_{2,i}\implies g_1 x_i g_1\inv \in U_1 g x_i g\inv U_1\inv $, and set $N=N_1\cap \bigcap_i N_{2,i}$. Then, \begin{equation*}\begin{split}\forall g_1\in N,x\in S\implies g_1 x g_1\inv &\in g_1 V x_i V\inv g_1\inv \\ &=g_1 V g_1\inv g_1 x_i g_1\inv g_1 V\inv g_1\inv \\&\subset U_1 g_1 x_i g_1\inv U_1\inv \\&\subset U_1 U_1 g x_i g\inv U_1\inv U_1\inv \\&\subset U_1 U_1 g V\inv x V g\inv U_1\inv U_1\inv \\&\subset U_1 U_1 g V\inv g\inv g x g\inv g V g\inv U_1\inv U_1\inv \\&\subset U_1 U_1 U_1\inv g x g\inv U_1 U_1\inv U_1\inv \\&\subset U g x g\inv U\inv \end{split}\end{equation*}
\subsection{} if $K$ is uniform-locally lower-totally-bounded then that gives a group topology on $Aut(K)$
\subsection{} if $K$ is locally lower-totally-bounded then that topology on $Aut(K)$ makes the action on $K$ jointly continuous, and the multiplication separately continuous.
\\But we can use the topology of uniform convergence on compact subsets of the locally compact part of the lower completion [see \ref{loc.compact}]. This is already known to be a group topology, and can subsequently be shown to equal the previous topology.

In intrinsic terms, the topology on $Aut(K)$ i s that of lower uniform convergence on any $S\subset K: \exists U \text{neighborhood} \{e\}: U S U\inv $ is lower-totally-bounded. If $K$ is locally lower-totally-bounded then every point of $K$ has a neighborhood with this property.
\section{Representation by a seminorm}
\subsection{definition:} $r:G\to\R$ is a seminorm iff \begin{equation*}\begin{split}r(e)&=0 \\\forall x\in G&\implies r(x\inv )=r(x) \\ \forall x,y\in G &\implies r(x)+r(y)\geq r(x y) \end{split}\end{equation*}
\subsubsection*{more notation} define $r^a(x)\equiv r(a x a\inv )$, which is a seminorm if $r$ is a seminorm
\subsection{}
\begin{itemize}
\item  every group’s topology is generated by a set of continuous seminorms
\item every uniformity is generated by a set of pseudo-metrics
\item for all $r$ and $s$ continuous seminorms on $G, d_{r,s}(x,y) \equiv \inf_{t\in G}\{r(xt)+s(ty)\}$is a pseudometric generating the lower uniformity
\end{itemize}
\subsection{} there is a map $\iota_r:G\to\R^{G\times G}$ given by $\iota_r(x)(a,b)=r(axb\inv )$.
\begin{itemize}
\item $\iota_r(x)$is bi-Katětov with respect to $r$ (see Uspenskij \cite{uspenskij2008subgroups})
\item the set of bi-Katětov functions is locally compact, and uniform-locally lower-totally-bounded in the product uniformity
\end{itemize}
\subsection{} the map $\iota_r$ is uniformly continuous from the lower uniformity on $G$ to the product uniformity on $\R^{G\times G}$
in particular, $\forall a,b,x,y\in G :|r(axb\inv )-r(ayb\inv )|\leq d_{r^a,r^b}(x,y)$
\subsection{} the image of $\iota_r$ is a topological group whose topology is generated by conjugates of $r$
\subsection{} a sufficient condition for the induced uniformity of $\iota_r(G)$ to be the same as its (intrinsic) lower uniformity is that $\forall a,b,x,y\in G: |r(axb\inv )-r(ayb\inv )|=d_{r^a,r^b}(x,y)$
\subsubsection*{} more concretely, it is sufficient that $\forall a,b,c,d\in G:r(ab\inv )\geq r(cd\inv ) \implies\exists t\in G: r(ab\inv ) = r(atc\inv )+r(cd\inv )+r(btd\inv )$, a geometric condition satisfied by many isometry groups, including those of the generalized Urysohn spaces, Hilbert spaces, and Hilbert hyperbolic spaces
\section{Completion}
\subsection{notation} $\complete{G}$ is notation for the lower completion of $G$ 
\subsubsection*{operations:} the following extend operations on $G$
\begin{itemize} 
\item inversion
\item left and right multiplication by elements of $G$
\item define a product relation $c\sim a\cdot b$ by \[(a,b,c)\in M \subset \complete{G} \times \complete{G}\times \complete{G}:M=\overline{\{(a,b,ab):a,b \in G\}}\]
not in general single-valued

$a\in G \lor b\in G \implies (c\sim a\cdot b \implies c=ab)$

$c\sim a\cdot b\iff a\sim c\cdot b\inv \iff b\sim a\inv \cdot c$
\end{itemize}
\subsection{topology} where $G$ is uniform-locally lower-totally-bounded, $\complete{G}$ is locally compact
\subsubsection*{} \label{loc.compact} where $G$ is locally lower-totally-bounded, $\complete{G}$ contains an open locally compact subset which contains G
\subsection{functor} any continuous group homomorphism f is also lower-uniformly-continuous, so it extends uniquely to a continuous map $\complete{f}$ of the lower completions
\subsection{...} similarly a continuous seminorm r is lower-uniformly-continuous, and extends to $\complete{r}:\complete{G}\to\R$\\
$c\sim a\cdot b\implies \complete{r}(a)+\complete{r}(b)\geq\complete{r}(c)$

and $d_{r,s}$ extends as well
\subsection{} define a generalized kernel, $\complete{\ker}(f)$, as $\complete{f}\inv (\{e\})$
\\closed, invariant under inversion and conjugation
\\$a,b\in\complete{\ker}(f)\land c\sim a\cdot b\implies c\in\complete{\ker}(f)$
\section{Generalized quotient maps}
\subsection{definition}: a continuous homomorphism $f$ is a generalized quotient if for some open set $U$, which is lower-totally-bounded, $f(U)$ has nonempty interior
\\ generalized proper: $f\inv $ of some open set is lower-totally-bounded
\subsection{} the image $f(G)$ is also locally lower-totally-bounded

if one seminorm of set has $r\inv ([0,\epsilon))$ lower-totally-bounded, map is gen. quotient\textit{}
\subsection{generalized kernel }
$(f$ is a generalized quotient and $\complete{\ker}(f)={e})\implies f$ is a homeomorphism
\\for above condition on $f, \complete{\ker}(f)$ is compact

does it need compactness?
\section{ Ascending central series}, also called upper central series.
Using the \textit{topological} ascending series, where all $Z_\alpha$ are closed. Definition: closure of union for limit ordinal
\subsection{} $ Z_\alpha(G)$ is locally compact: in fact, 
\subsection{} if $G $ is locally lower-totally-bounded, and upper complete, and $U,U_1$  nbhd.s of $e$ in $G$ such that $U_1 U U_1\inv $ is lower-totally-bounded, $U\cap Z_\alpha(G) $ is right-totally-bounded for any ordinal $\alpha$
\subsubsection*{proof}by induction
\begin{itemize}
\item $Z_0(G) = \{e\}$ which is compact
\item $Z_\alpha(G)$ right-totally-bounded implies $Z_{\alpha+1}(G)$ is right-totally-bounded:
\\ given $V$ nbhd. of $e$, choose $V_1$ nbhd. of $e$ so that $V_1 V_1 V_1\inv \subset V \cap U_1$. Since $U$ is lower-totally-bounded, $\exists x_i \in U \cap Z_{\alpha+1} :U \cap Z_{\alpha+1} \subset \bigcup_i V_1 x_i V_1\inv $. Using the definition, \[V_1 x_i V_1\inv = \bigcup_{a \in V_1} a x_i a\inv a V_1\inv \subset x_i \{x_i\inv a x_i a\inv: a \in V_1 \} V_1 V_1\inv \] $a x_i a\inv \in x_i Z_\alpha \cap V_1 U V_1\inv $, and $V_1 (V_1 U V_1\inv) V_1\inv \subset U_1 U U_1\inv $ so $x_i\inv a x_i a\inv $ is right-totally-bounded. 
\item let $Z=\bigcup_{\beta < \alpha} Z_\beta$. As before, $\exists x_i \in U \cap Z : U \cap Z \subset \bigcup_i V_1 x_i V_1\inv $. for each $i$, $\exists \beta_i < \alpha : x_i \in Z_{\beta_i}(G)$. Thus, $a x_i a\inv \in Z_{\beta_i} $ and the rest of the proof as before.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Locally  compact normal subgroups}
\subsubsection{unproven}
using the  same techniques, if $\mathbf L $ is a collection of locally compact normal subgroups then $\prod \LL \equiv \{ x_1  \dots  x_n : x_i \in L_i \in \LL\}$ is also,
so there is a unique maximal locally compact normal subgroup
\subsubsection{better}
let $U$ be a lower-locally-compact nbhd. of $e$ and let $\LL_U $ be the set of normal subgroups $L$ such that for all $V, W$ nbhd.s of $e$ such that $V W V\inv \subset U $, $W \cap L$ is right-totally-bounded.
\\ $ \LL_U \cap \LL_V = \LL_{U \cup V}$
\\ $L_U \equiv \prod \LL_U \in \LL_U$ and so, locally compact
\\ $\{g \in G : \forall h \in G, [g, h] \in L_U \} \in \LL_U $
